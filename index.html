    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `Friends Al Brunetti and Bertie Pavlidis, started The Pontian Club almost accidentally. Long sunday lunches for mates quickly grew into a re-occurring Greek food pop-up for locals, with freshly made moussaka and spanakopita. As the club grew more popular, ex-Gimlet chef Oscar Tan also joined the duo. The team swings a simple rotating menu of Greek staples each week based on what’s growing at Paldivis’s family farm in Connewarre. You can expect crispy sardines with lemon for $14, generous servings of moussaka for $15, and Greek salad for $10. Past menus have also included beef bifteki, chicken skewers, green beans and fava. For something sweet, there’s olive oil cake – perfect with $5 ouzo or $4 house wine – to round out the lunch. There are also Alfa beers for $5 a pop and live music throughout the afternoon. “It doesn’t feel like you’re at a pop-up or a restaurant, it’s more like you are at a family event,” Tan tells Broadsheet. The Pontian Club is hosted every Sunday from 12pm to 3pm. Walk-ins only.`;
